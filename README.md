# Landing-Page-Project
My final project for Udacity's FEND Program

This landing page uses Javascript to:

- Create a Navigation Bar with links to each section on the page
- Distinguish the section that is displayed in the viewport by adding special styling 
- Smoothly scroll from one section to another when clicking on links in the Navigation Bar
